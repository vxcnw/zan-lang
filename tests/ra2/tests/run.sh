# standalone program whose stdout must match tests/expected_<name>.out.
#
# The parsers live in this example rather than stdlib, so --auto-stdlib cannot
# find them; every test is compiled against the whole formats/ directory. That
# is cheap and saves maintaining a per-test dependency list.
#
# No test may read data/ -- that is the user's own game install. Tests use
# published vectors and synthetic buffers only.

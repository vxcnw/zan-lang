# designed form (src/IdeForm.zform), the GenForm generator projects it into a
# partial class with the program's Main, code-behind src/IdeForm.zan holds the
# logic and the rest of the shell/editor lives under src/. zanc compiles
# everything, drives the bundled linker, and links the static native GUI
# runtime (Win32 backend) + the embedded skin packs.

# known install locations before failing: the script needs clang, llvm-ar and
# llvm-readobj, all in the same bin directory. NOTE: a bare "clang" command
# name is unreliable in some restricted sessions even with the dir prepended,
# so every native call below uses the full path via $clangExe / $clangDir.

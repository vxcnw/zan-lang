# publish_ide.ps1 -- Assemble a self-contained, redistributable Zan IDE into
# the per-platform release directory  dist\win-x64  (other platforms get their
# own dist\<platform> when their builds exist, e.g. dist\linux-x64).
#
# The published tree is intentionally minimal: only the files an end user needs
# to run the IDE and compile/run Zan programs. Nothing else should be dropped
# into dist -- treat it as the single, clean release output.
#
# ZanIDE.exe is the real IDE, shipped flat: the skin packs are embedded
# inside the exe, so it has no dll beside it.
#
#   dist\win-x64\
#     ZanIDE.exe           the IDE (skins embedded)
#     toolchain\          the Zan compiler + its self-contained linker bundle:
#                           zanc.exe, ld.exe, mingw\, linux-musl\ ...
#                         (the IDE finds zanc here; zanc finds its linker next
#                          to itself in this same folder)
#     stdlib\             standard library sources (zanc auto-includes from here)
#     examples\           a few sample programs opened by the IDE's Examples pane
#     templates\          built-in New Project templates (data-driven, editable)
#     README.txt          prerequisites + how to run
#
# No prerequisite on the target machine: zanc links via the bundled linker in
# dist\toolchain (ld.exe + mingw\ runtime), and zan-dap debugs with the bundled
# gdb. A system clang on PATH is only a fallback if the bundled linker files
# are removed.
#
# Usage:  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\publish_ide.ps1

Zan IDE - self-contained release
================================

This folder is the SDK installation. It is not a workspace: create your Zan
projects anywhere else and run the IDE from here.

Contents
  ZanIDE.exe     The Zan IDE. It runs from this folder; the GUI runtime is
                 statically
                 linked in, and stdlib/toolchain resolve from here.
  (skins, ide.css, help topics)
                 Baked into ZanIDE.exe as embedded resources and read from
                 memory -- no files required beside the exe. A file of the same
                 name next to the exe (ide.css, skins\, docs\topics.json) still
                 wins, which is how you override one without a rebuild.
  toolchain\     The Zan compiler and everything it links with, all as siblings:
                   zanc.exe                the compiler
                   zan-lsp.exe             language server (for external editors)
                   zan-dap.exe             debug adapter (for external editors)
                   zanfmt/zandoc           format / doc CLIs
                   ld.exe, mingw\          bundled linker + MinGW-w64 runtime
                   linux-musl\             sysroot for --target linux-* builds
                   debugger\bin\gdb.exe    bundled native debugger (used by
                                           zan-dap; no system gdb needed)
                   zanrt_io*, zanrt_sync*  runtime objects
                 The IDE locates zanc here, and zanc finds its linker / sysroot
                 next to itself in this same folder, so producing an .exe needs
                 no external toolchain. Keep this folder intact.
  stdlib\        Standard library sources. zanc auto-includes the .zan files
                 it needs from here; keep this folder next to ZanIDE.exe.
  knowledge\     Offline knowledge base for the built-in assistant:
                   symbols.json  API index generated from stdlib (api_search)
                   gallery.json  golden-example catalog (example tool)
                 The assistant queries these instead of grepping the stdlib.
  examples\      Sample programs shown in the IDE's Examples pane (optional).
  templates\     Built-in New Project templates (one folder each, with a
                 template.manifest). Edit or drop in your own folders to add
                 templates -- no rebuild needed.
  tools\         Zan tools shown in the IDE's Tools panel (double-click to run,
                 right-click to open the source), plus zan-mcp.exe -- the MCP
                 server for AI clients. See the AI section below.
  ai\            Templates installed into your own projects by
                 "tools\zan-mcp.exe --init-agent" (see below).
  llms.txt       AI entry index of this folder (generated from what shipped):
                 the paths to the rules, tools, knowledge, skills and docs an
                 AI agent needs, readable without an MCP connection.
  AI_README.md   How AI uses this SDK (in Chinese): setup, the MCP tool
                 catalog, skills, the knowledge base. Start here when wiring
                 up an AI coding tool.
  README.CN.txt  Chinese version of this readme.

AI coding tools (Claude Code / Cursor / Copilot / Windsurf)
  Enable them per PROJECT, not here. Two ways, same implementation:

    In the IDE   Assistant panel -> "为当前项目启用 AI 接入" (one click on the
                 project you have open).
    Without it   tools\zan-mcp.exe --init-agent D:\path\to\your-project
                 (add --force to overwrite files that already exist)

  Either one writes into THAT project, with this SDK's paths filled in:
    AGENTS.md            the rules an AI agent must follow in Zan code
    .agents\skills\      zan-development / zan-debugging / zan-mcp workflows
    .mcp.json            Claude Code and most clients
    .cursor\mcp.json     Cursor
    .vscode\mcp.json     VS Code / Copilot
  Then open that project in your AI editor and it starts the server itself.
  Existing files are kept, not overwritten, and reported.

  tools\zan-mcp.exe
                 The MCP server behind all of it, run as
                   tools\zan-mcp.exe --stdio <your project dir>
                 It answers what a model would otherwise guess at:
                 zan_start_here (project layout, commands, rules, tools in one
                 call), zan_api_search (exact stdlib signatures), zan_example
                 (shipped, build-verified programs), zan_compile /
                 zan_build_project (structured diagnostics), plus workspace
                 file access. Add --read-only or --no-exec to restrict it;
                 without --stdio it serves the same API over HTTP. It finds
                 knowledge\, toolchain\ and stdlib\ one level up on its own
                 (--sdk-root <dir> overrides).
  ai\            The templates the two commands above install (AGENTS.md,
                 skills\, mcp.json / cursor.mcp.json / vscode.mcp.json). They
                 still carry <ZAN_MCP> / <ZAN_SDK> / <ZAN_PROJECT> placeholders,
                 so use --init-agent rather than copying them by hand.
  docs\AI_ONBOARDING.md
                 The full connection guide (also covers zan-lsp / zan-dap for
                 editors that speak LSP/DAP directly).

  Website mirror    The same ai\ content (rules + skills + mcp configs) is
                  mirrored on the project website at /ai-connect, generated
                  from this pack so they never drift. This SDK copy is the
                  authoritative one that --init-agent installs; the site copy
                  is for reading.

Requirement
  None for normal use: zanc links via the bundled toolchain\ folder, so no
  external LLVM/clang install is needed. (If the linker files under toolchain\
  are removed, zanc falls back to a system clang on PATH.)

Run
  Double-click ZanIDE.exe (or run it from a terminal). Everything the IDE
  needs to build and run Zan programs ships in this folder.

Note
  This folder is produced by scripts\publish_ide.ps1. Do not hand-edit or
  drop unrelated files here -- re-run the publish script to refresh it.

Zan IDE 自包含发布包
====================

本目录是 SDK 安装目录，不是工作区：请把 Zan 项目建在别处，从这里运行 IDE。

目录内容
  ZanIDE.exe     Zan 集成开发环境。GUI 运行时已静态链接进 exe，皮肤/帮助主题为内嵌
                 资源从内存读取，旁边不需要任何 dll 或数据文件。在 exe 旁边放
                 同名文件（ide.css、skins\、docs\topics.json）仍会优先生效，
                 这就是不重新打包就替换它们的办法。
  toolchain\     Zan 编译器及其链接所需的一切，全部作为同目录的兄弟文件平铺：
                   zanc.exe                编译器
                   zan-lsp.exe             语言服务器（供外部编辑器）
                   zan-dap.exe             调试适配器（供外部编辑器）
                   zanfmt.exe / zandoc.exe 格式化 / 文档生成命令行
                   ld.exe, mingw\          内置链接器 + MinGW-w64 运行库
                   linux-musl\             --target linux-* 静态 ELF 的 sysroot
                   debugger\bin\gdb.exe    内置原生调试器（zan-dap 使用）
                   zanrt_io*, zanrt_sync*  运行时目标文件
                 IDE 在这里找 zanc，zanc 在自己旁边找链接器 / sysroot / 标准库，
                 生成 .exe 不依赖任何外部工具链。请保持本目录完整。
  stdlib\        标准库源码。zanc 自动按需引入；请与 ZanIDE.exe 放在一起。
  knowledge\     内置 AI 助手的离线知识库：
                   symbols.json  由随包 stdlib 生成的 API 索引（api_search 用）
                   gallery.json  金标示例目录（example 工具用）
                 助手查这些索引，而不是去 grep 标准库源码。
  examples\      IDE 示例面板展示的示例程序（可选）。
  templates\     内置"新建项目"模板（每个模板一个目录，含 template.manifest）。
                 编辑或放入新目录即可增删模板——无需重新构建。
  tools\         IDE 工具面板展示的 Zan 工具（双击运行），以及 zan-mcp.exe——
                 AI 客户端的 MCP 服务器。见下方 AI 一节。
  ai\            由 "tools\zan-mcp.exe --init-agent" 安装进你自己项目的模板
                 （AGENTS.md、skills\、三个 mcp 配置），见下。
  llms.txt       本目录的 AI 索引（按实际发布内容生成）：AI 需要的规矩、工具、
                 知识库、技能、文档路径一览，没接 MCP 也能读。
  AI_README.md   怎么让 AI 用这个 SDK（中文）：接入方式、MCP 工具目录、技能、
                 知识库、常见问题。接 AI 工具前先读它。
  docs\          AI_ONBOARDING.md（AI 接入完整指南）、TOOLING.md、ai-assist.md、
                 MCP_HOSTING.md、AI_DEV_INFRASTRUCTURE.md。

AI 编程工具（Claude Code / Cursor / Copilot / Windsurf）
  按"项目"启用，而不是在这里启用。两种方式，同一实现：

    IDE 里    助手面板 ->「为当前项目启用 AI 接入」（对你打开的项目一键完成）
    命令行    tools\zan-mcp.exe --init-agent D:\path\to\your-project
              （加 --force 覆盖已存在的文件）

  两种方式都会把内容写进那个项目，并填好本 SDK 的真实路径：
    AGENTS.md            AI 在 Zan 代码里必须守的规矩
    .agents\skills\      zan-development / zan-debugging / zan-mcp 三个技能
    .mcp.json            Claude Code 及多数客户端
    .cursor\mcp.json     Cursor
    .vscode\mcp.json     VS Code / Copilot
  然后用你的 AI 编辑器打开那个项目，客户端会自己启动服务器。
  已存在的文件保留不覆盖，并逐个报告。

  tools\zan-mcp.exe
                 背后的 MCP 服务器，运行方式：
                   tools\zan-mcp.exe --stdio <你的项目目录>
                 它回答模型原本只能靠猜的问题：zan_start_here（项目布局、命令、
                 规矩、工具目录一次拿全）、zan_api_search（标准库精确签名）、
                 zan_example（可编译的官方示例）、zan_compile / zan_build_project
                 （结构化诊断），外加工作区文件读写。加 --read-only 或 --no-exec
                 收权；不带 --stdio 时以 HTTP 提供同一套 API。它会自己在上一级
                 找 knowledge\、toolchain\ 和 stdlib\（--sdk-root <目录> 可覆盖）。
  ai\            上面两条命令安装的模板。里面保留 <ZAN_MCP> / <ZAN_SDK> /
                 <ZAN_PROJECT> 占位符，所以请用 --init-agent，不要手工复制。
  docs\AI_ONBOARDING.md
                 完整接入指南（也覆盖 zan-lsp / zan-dap 直连 LSP/DAP 的编辑器）。

  官网镜像        ai\ 的同样内容（规矩 + 技能 + mcp 配置）镜像在项目官网
                 /ai-connect，由本包生成，两边不会漂移。本 SDK 里这份是权威
                 副本，--init-agent 安装的就是它；网站上那份供在线阅读。

环境要求
  正常使用为零依赖：zanc 通过内置 toolchain\ 里的链接器完成链接，不需要安装
  外部 LLVM/clang。（若删除 toolchain\ 下的链接器文件，zanc 回退到 PATH 上
  的系统 clang。）

运行
  双击 ZanIDE.exe（或在终端里运行）。构建和运行 Zan 程序所需的一切都在本目录。

注意
  本目录由 scripts\publish_ide.ps1 生成。不要手工编辑或往里放无关文件——
  重新运行发布脚本即可刷新。

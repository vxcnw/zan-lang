# Platform Targets

Status of Zan's cross-platform / cross-compilation support: what is **implemented**
(build + link + run), what carries **cross-compile restrictions** (implemented, but
some runtime subsystems are unavailable when producing that target from another
host), and what is **future** (needs new target entries plus runtime work). Also
lists, per platform, the runtime subsystems that must exist before a target can be
considered complete.

This file is the source of truth for target support. Keep it in sync with:
- `src/compiler/crosscomp.c` — the target table (`s_targets[]`) and triple parsing.
- `src/compiler/main.c` — the actual link paths (`zan_target_host`, the
  `cross_compiling` branches, `zan_driver_subdir`).
- `stdlib/System/Data/<Module>/drivers/<target>/` — per-target native DB drivers.

## 1. Target table (`--list-targets`)

Fourteen targets are currently declared in `crosscomp.c` (`s_targets[]`):

| Name          | Triple                          | Notes                    |
|---------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `win-x64`     | `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`        | Windows x86-64           |
| `win-arm64`   | `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc`       | Windows ARM64            |
| `linux-x64`   | `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`      | Linux x86-64 (glibc)     |
| `linux-musl`  | `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`     | Linux x86-64 (musl, static) |
| `linux-arm64` | `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`     | Linux ARM64              |
| `macos-x64`   | `x86_64-apple-macosx`           | macOS Intel              |
| `macos-arm64` | `aarch64-apple-macosx`          | macOS Apple Silicon      |
| `wasm32`      | `wasm32-unknown-wasi`           | WebAssembly (WASI)       |
| `linux-riscv64` | `riscv64-unknown-linux-musl`   | RISC-V 64-bit Linux (musl, static) |
| `riscv64`     | `riscv64-unknown-linux-musl`    | RISC-V 64-bit Linux (alias of `linux-riscv64`) |
| `android-x64` | `x86_64-linux-android28`        | Android x86-64 (bionic; static CLI, GUI APK) |
| `android-arm64` | `aarch64-linux-android28`     | Android ARM64 (bionic; static CLI, GUI APK) |
| `ohos-x64`    | `x86_64-unknown-linux-ohos`     | OpenHarmony x86-64 (musl, static) |
| `ohos-arm64`  | `aarch64-unknown-linux-ohos`    | OpenHarmony ARM64 (musl, static) |

Being listed here means the triple parses and platform macros
(`WINDOWS`/`LINUX`/`MACOS`/`ANDROID`/`OHOS` — OHOS also implies `LINUX`+`MUSL`)
plus arch macros (`ARM64`/`X86_64`) are defined for the
target. All fourteen now also have a working link path — see §2 for the per-target
runtime restrictions that apply when cross-compiling.

---

## 2. Implementation status

Every declared target has a link path in `main.c`. What differs is **which runtime
subsystems are available** for a given target, and whether it is being built
**natively** (host OS == target OS, full support) or **cross** (from another host,
possibly restricted). The only case that still errors `cross-compilation to '<triple>'
is not supported yet` is a target OS outside {Linux, Windows, macOS, WASI} — none of
the declared targets fall there today.

### Native builds (host OS == target OS) — full support

| Target                     | Native link path                                                     |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `win-x64` / `win-arm64`    | Bundled GNU `ld.exe` (`<zanc>/ld.exe`; `ld.lld` is only a fallback) + MinGW-w64 runtime (`<zanc>/mingw`), `*-w64-windows-gnu` ABI. `win-<arch>/mingw` is for cross-compiling only. |
| `linux-x64` / `linux-arm64`| Host toolchain / bundled musl (see cross below).                     |
| `macos-x64` / `macos-arm64`| Host toolchain on the matching Mac (Cocoa GUI, threads, async all available). |

A native build uses the full runtime (async I/O reactor, threads/atomics, GUI),
because it is the same code path a normal `zanc` invocation on that OS takes.

### Cross builds (`--target` from a different host) — implemented, with restrictions

| Cross target                       | How it links (from any host)                                       | Restrictions when cross-compiling |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `linux-x64` / `linux-musl` / `linux-arm64` / `riscv64` | `ld.lld -static` + bundled musl sysroot `<zanc>/{linux-musl,linux-arm64,linux-riscv64}` → a dependency-free static ELF. | **None** — async-socket (`zanrt_io.o`) *and* the sync runtime (`zanrt_sync.o`: `AtomicInt`/`SharedTable`) are both linked in. "Build on Windows/macOS → upload → run on Linux" just works. |
| `win-x64` / `win-arm64`            | `ld.lld` MinGW driver + bundled `win-<arch>/mingw/lib`; PE output. | Async-socket (`zanrt_io.o` / `zanrt_io_mt.o`), sync runtime (`zanrt_sync.o`), timer (`zanrt_timer.o`) and embed-API (`zan_embed_api.o`) objects are staged at `win-<arch>/` and linked on demand — no remaining cross restriction. Objects are maintained by `scripts/build_win_rt.sh` and refreshed by the drivers workflow. |
| `macos-x64` / `macos-arm64`        | `ld64.lld -arch <arch> -platform_version macos 11.0` + bundled `macos/libSystem.tbd` (MIT symbol stub; no Apple SDK redistributed) + the Mach-O runtime objects in `macos/<arch>/` for async/atomics; Mach-O output linking `-lSystem` plus, for GUI programs, the prebuilt `stdlib/Gui/drivers/macos-<arch>/libzan_gui.dylib` (`@rpath` install name; its own Cocoa/WebKit dependencies bind on the target Mac, so no framework stubs are needed here). arm64 output is ad-hoc code-signed by the linker (`LC_CODE_SIGNATURE`, `CS_ADHOC|CS_LINKER_SIGNED`), which is what Apple Silicon requires to execute it at all. | Async-socket, `AtomicInt`/`SharedTable` and Cocoa GUI all link. Both `macos-arm64` and `macos-x64` GUI dylibs are committed. Nothing here has been run on a real Mac — verification stops at "links + correct Mach-O/signature structure". Developer ID signing/notarization is a separate, not-yet-implemented step needed only for distribution. |
| `wasm32` (WASI)                    | `wasm-ld` + bundled wasm32 sysroot (`crt1.o`); WASI command module. | **No async-socket**; single-threaded WASI model; try/catch works (WebAssembly EH, see §4). |

Key properties:
- **Linux is the universal cross target** — full-featured and self-contained from
  any host.
- **Windows cross used to be the restricted one**; the committed `win-<arch>/`
  runtime objects (async-socket, sync, timer, embed) now link on demand, so no
  cross restriction remains — building natively on Windows is still the
  fastest path for local iteration.
- **macOS cross is link-complete for both architectures** (console, async, atomics,
  Cocoa GUI), but only link-verified — no real-Mac run has happened yet.
- The sync runtime (`AtomicInt`/`SharedTable`) is available natively everywhere and,
  when cross-compiling, for **Linux, macOS and Windows** targets (`main.c` errors
  early on targets outside that set, e.g. WASI).

### macOS: covering both architectures

Both Mac architectures go through the same `ld64.lld` path from any host; the only
asymmetry is the GUI driver, which is a per-arch binary. Both are now
committed, and both come out of `.github/workflows/drivers.yml` on the same
`macos-14` runner (`-mmacosx-version-min=11.0`, ad-hoc signed): the arm64 one
natively, the x64 one cross-built with `clang -arch x86_64`, because the
`macos-13` Intel runner queues indefinitely. A Universal 2 binary is still made
the usual way, by combining the two slices with `lipo -create`.

---

## 3. Runtime subsystems (what each target needs)

A target is only "complete" when these back ends exist for it. Current coverage:

| Subsystem            | Windows | Linux | macOS | Notes / mechanism                         |
|----------------------|:-------:|:-----:|:-----:|-------------------------------------------|
| I/O reactor          | IOCP    | epoll | kqueue| `src/runtime` async socket/file reactor; **cross builds to WASI cannot link it** (macOS cross links `macos/<arch>/zanrt_io{,_mt}.o`; Windows cross links `win-<arch>/zanrt_io{,_mt}.o`) |
| Threads / sync       | Win32   | pthread| pthread| mutex, semaphore (macOS uses GCD dispatch), atomics; **`AtomicInt`/`SharedTable` cross to Linux, macOS and Windows** |
| C FFI (`DllImport`)  | crt/msvcrt → CRT | libc | libc | resolved by the linker; names unified as `crt` |
| Filesystem / dirent  | ✅      | glibc layout | Darwin layout | `Directory.zan` branches on dirent offsets |
| Monotonic clock      | ✅      | `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`=1 | =6 | `Stopwatch` |
| GUI backend          | Win32   | X11   | Cocoa | Wayland and all other windowing systems are stubs; macOS cross links the committed `macos-<arch>/libzan_gui.dylib`, whose Cocoa/WebKit dependencies bind on the target Mac |
| Native DB/TLS drivers | `win-x64`/`win-arm64` | `linux-x64`/`linux-arm64` | `macos-x64`/`macos-arm64` | `<stdlib>/System/Data/<Module>/drivers/<target>/` and `<stdlib>/System/Net/Tls/drivers/<target>/`; binaries committed per target |

On macOS, versioned native dylibs such as `libssl.3.dylib` and `libpq.5.dylib`
are named by the owning driver's `<lib>.bundle` manifest. The compiler uses its
first safe entry when the unversioned `lib<lib>.dylib` link name is absent.

Anything not listed (Wayland, BSD, mobile, WASM GUI, bare-metal) has **no** back end
yet.

---

## 4. Per-platform gap analysis (future targets)

Difficulty is for **CLI/compute** first; GUI is a separate, larger effort on each.

### Async-socket / sync runtime for Windows cross — ✅ done
- Done for macOS: `scripts/build_macos_rt.sh` compiles `rt_io.c` (kqueue) and
  `rt_sync.c` for `{aarch64,x86_64}-macos.11.0` with `zig cc` (it carries the Darwin
  libc headers, so no Apple SDK and no Mac are needed) into
  `toolchain/macos/<arch>/zanrt_{io,io_mt,sync}.o`, which ship next to `zanc` and are
  linked on demand. Every symbol they import is in the bundled `libSystem.tbd` —
  `scripts/check_macos_rt.py` asserts that, so a missing stub is caught here instead
  of in a user's link.
- Done for Windows: `scripts/build_win_rt.sh` compiles `rt_io.c` (IOCP),
  `rt_sync.c` and `rt_timer.c` for `{x86_64,aarch64}-windows-gnu` into
  `toolchain/win-<arch>/zanrt_{io,io_mt,sync,timer}.o` (plus `zan_embed_api.o`),
  staged beside the mingw runtime and linked on demand by the `ld.lld` MinGW
  cross path in `main.c` — lifting the former async-socket / sync-runtime cross
  restrictions.

### macOS GUI cross (Cocoa) — link-complete for arm64 and x64
- `src/runtime/gui_runtime_mac.m` is Objective-C against Cocoa/CoreText/QuartzCore/
  IOSurface/WebKit headers, which only the Apple SDK provides, so it is built on a
  Mac by `.github/workflows/drivers.yml` and the resulting `libzan_gui.dylib` is
  committed under `stdlib/Gui/drivers/macos-<arch>/`.
- **No framework `.tbd` stubs are needed.** Because that dylib is a *dynamic*
  library with an `@rpath` install name, the cross link only resolves
  `_zan_gui_*` against it; its Cocoa/WebKit imports are bound by dyld on the target
  Mac. `--publish` copies the dylib next to the executable, which the emitted
  `LC_RPATH @loader_path` then finds.
- Remaining: an actual run on Mac hardware — everything so far is link/structure
  verification only.

### Android (`android-x64` / `android-arm64`) — CLI works; GUI renders, verified on an emulator
- Objects emit for the `*-linux-android28` triple (API 28: rt_sync.c's
  `glob()` usage needs bionic 28). Console programs statically link with
  `ld.lld` against a **committed NDK sysroot subset** at
  `toolchain/android-<arch>/` (`crtbegin_static.o`, `crtend_android.o`,
  `libc.a`, `libm.a`, `libdl.a`, `libclang_rt.builtins.a`; bionic's
  zstd-compressed debug sections are decompressed so any lld can link it).
  The workflow is `zanc --target android-x64 -o app` →
  `adb push app /data/local/tmp/` → `adb shell chmod 755 + run` — verified
  end-to-end on an API 35 x86_64 emulator (try/catch, file IO, atomics,
  threads API surface, async coroutine driver; output matches native).
- Runtime objects (`zanrt_io/sync/file/timer.o`, `zan_embed_api.o`) are built
  with the NDK clang per `scripts\build_cross_rt.cmd` (zig cc has no bionic
  target); bionic lacks `shm_open`, which an `__ANDROID__` shim inside
  `rt_sync.c` backs with files under `$ZAN_SHM_DIR` (default
  `/data/local/tmp`).
- `--fast-alloc` is unavailable on Android: the wrapped-malloc allocator
  interposes bionic's own internals and crashes during their TLS bootstrap.
- **GUI**: the window shell is a **NativeActivity** (`ZAN_GUI_ANDROID_NATIVE`,
  `gui_runtime_android_native.c`): NDK `native_app_glue` runs `android_main`
  in-process, translates the `ANativeActivity` lifecycle (INIT/TERM/PAUSE/
  RESUME/FOCUS) into the event loop (kind 7 attach / kind 8 close / kind 12
  pause-resume), translates `AInputQueue` touch into pointer events, and
  presents the CPU surface through EGL (RGBA texture upload with dirty-rect
  subimage, BGRA-swap shader, `eglSwapBuffers`). `stdlib/Gui/drivers/
  android-{x64,arm64}/` ship the static `libzan_gui.a` (FreeType baked in)
  that `zanc` links into the emitted `libmain.so`; the APK shell
  (`toolchain/apk-shell/`, `android.app.NativeActivity` +
  `android.app.lib_name=main` metadata) dlopens it. Verified on the
  emulator: first-frame pixel match, touch -> Ui.Clicked, clean exit.
- **Text**: the GUI driver statically links FreeType (no new DT_NEEDED) and
  resolves faces at runtime: `/system/etc/fonts.xml` is parsed for the
  ROM's default family (MiSans on MIUI, HarmonySans on Huawei — the
  weight-400 upright entry) and the `zh` fallback family (with its ttc
  face index), so ROM-level font customization is honored; if the file is
  missing or unparsable the build falls back to AOSP's fixed chain
  (Roboto → DroidSans → NotoSansCJK ttc face 2, then NotoSerifCJK /
  DroidSansFallback for CJK glyphs). Desktop builds keep fontconfig.
- **One-shot APK**: `zanc --publish --target android-x64 --emit-apk app.apk`
  compiles, links `libmain.so`, packs the NativeActivity shell and signs it
  in one command — no Android SDK needed. Packaging lives in
  `src/compiler/apk.c`: the binary `AndroidManifest.xml` comes from a
  precompiled template (`toolchain/apk-shell/`, package + label patched in
  its string pool — no aapt2), `classes.dex`/`resources.arsc` are fixed
  prebuilts, the zip writer aligns STORED native libs and keeps
  `resources.arsc` uncompressed (Android 11+ requirement), and signing runs
  the bundled `apksigner.jar` through a discovered Java (JAVA_HOME / PATH;
  on Windows a portable JRE is auto-downloaded to `%USERPROFILE%\.zan` on
  first use) with an auto-generated debug keystore. `--apk-package <name>`
  and `--apk-label <text>` override the identity derived from the input
  file name (multi-file programs should set them). `[DllImport]` libraries
  that Android cannot provide (openssl, odbc, libpq — anything with no
  bundled `android-<arch>` driver .so and no sysroot stub) are stubbed and
  dropped from the link, same policy as the Linux/macOS cross paths: the
  build succeeds, calls fail at runtime with a compile-time warning.
  The IDE's publish
  dialog lists `android-x64`/`android-arm64` and emits the same APKs.
  arm64 APKs run on device (verified on an x86_64 emulator via lib
  translation: gallery + form demos render with correct CJK text).
- **Touch & back gesture** (phone): finger events are translated in
  `gui_runtime_android_native.c` — first-finger tracking with an 8 px slop
  (tap → synthesized click, drag → 1:1 synthesized wheel with fling inertia
  scaled by `g_dpi`). The system BACK gesture/key becomes the regular kind-8
  window-close event without touching `g_quit`: the app decides (e.g. the
  gallery's phone-mode drawer closes first; a second BACK leaves `main`,
  which finishes the NativeActivity task). Display fit never scales below the device's native
  density on Android (`App.Show()` `#if ANDROID` floor): UI renders at native
  density with in-page scrolling instead of shrinking.
- **Permissions**: the APK-shell manifest template needs
  `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>` — modern
  Android returns `EPERM` from `socket()` for apps without the grant, so
  even loopback TCP fails. The canonical text source now lives at
  `toolchain/apk-shell/AndroidManifest.xml` (regeneration instructions
  inside; `src/compiler/apk.c` patches exactly one `dev.zan.app` package +
  one `Zan App` label string in the pool), and the precompiled
  `AndroidManifest.xml.bin` next to it ships with the permission.
- **TLS**: `System.Net.Tls` ships bionic-compatible OpenSSL drivers for both
  ABIs at `stdlib/System/Net/Tls/drivers/android-{arm64,x64}/` — Termux
  3.6.3 builds with the SONAME/NEEDED names shortened in place
  (`libssl.so.3` → `libssl.so`) because Android only extracts `lib*.so` to
  `nativeLibraryDir`; each `*.bundle` lists one `.so` so `--emit-apk` packs
  them into `lib/<abi>/`. Verified on the emulator with a loopback probe
  (TLS server + client in one APK on 127.0.0.1, self-signed CA embedded and
  trusted via `AddTrustedCert`): handshake, **certificate chain
  verification**, and a full HTTPS request/response round trip pass on both
  arm64 (Berberis translation) and x64. PEM material passed to
  `TlsContext.CreateServer` must be written to a real file first — OpenSSL's
  internal `fopen` cannot see `--embed` virtual files.
- Known Android issues (see TASKS.md A88): a `try/catch` directly in a void
  `Thread.Start` entry hangs on android-arm64 — keep the entry try-free and
  `await` an async method that owns the try (the `ImageHttp` shape); a TLS
  server thread that exits immediately after writing can leave the peer's
  `RecvAsync` waiting forever (destructor `SSL_shutdown` interplay); real
  device + real egress HTTPS is still unverified (emulator has no network).

### HarmonyOS / OpenHarmony — done for CLI (see below), GUI future
- OHOS native uses a musl-based NDK; for CLI/services this is close to Android.
- **`ohos-x64` / `ohos-arm64` are implemented** (`-linux-ohos` triples, static
  `ld.lld` link against a bundled NDK sysroot subset in
  `toolchain/ohos-<arch>/`, built per the recipe in
  `scripts/build_cross_rt.cmd` with `OHOS_NDK` set). Deployment mirrors adb:
  `hdc file send <exe> /data/local/tmp/` + `chmod 755` + run — verified
  end-to-end on an OpenHarmony x86-64 QEMU VM (try/catch, file IO,
  collections, monotonic timer). OHOS musl libc.a exposes pthread/epoll but
  has no `shm_open`; the `__OHOS__` shim in rt_sync.c (shared with Android)
  backs shared tables with files under `$ZAN_SHM_DIR`. OHOS also implies the
  `LINUX`/`MUSL` platform macros plus `OHOS` for source-level guards. The
  sysroot's `libm.a`/`libdl.a` are empty stubs (math/dl live in libc.a), so
  they are not committed.
- GUI would need an ArkUI/native back end.

### iOS (`arm64-apple-ios`) — medium-hard
- AOT-only fits us (we don't rely on JIT); kqueue works.
- Requires the iOS SDK/sysroot, code signing + provisioning, and a UIKit GUI
  back end. App Store sandboxing restricts process/FS APIs.

### WebAssembly (`wasm32-wasi`) — console/file-IO compute works; GUI/threads/networking are hard
- CLI, string/collection compute and **file IO** (via the split `zanrt_file.o` +
  `zanrt_timer.o` + `zanrt_wasm.o` objects; rebuild with
  `scripts\build_cross_rt.cmd <zig.exe>`, staleness tracked in
  `scripts/check_toolchain_stale.py`) link and run today — verified end-to-end
  under Node's WASI. Threading/sync and the epoll/kqueue/IOCP reactor assume
  threads + syscalls, so networking and GUI need a different model (async host
  imports / canvas/DOM). ARC itself is fine (refcounting over `malloc`).
- `try/catch` works on wasm32 via **LLVM WebAssembly EH** (the engine unwinds
  instead of longjmp): a `try` becomes a catchswitch/catchpad whose unwind
  edges are the invokes the compiler emits for every call inside the body,
  `throw` becomes an invoke of `__cxa_throw` (rewritten to the wasm `throw`
  instruction with the `__cpp_exception` tag; the tag and the raise symbol are
  defined by `toolchain/wasm32/zanrt_ehtag.o`, built with mozbuild clang's
  `-fexceptions -mllvm -wasm-enable-eh` — zig's clang cannot emit it). Codegen
  needs the `--wasm-enable-eh` cl option plus `+exception-handling,+reference-types`.
  Verified end-to-end under Node: typed catch, cross-function unwind, nested
  try, and finally all match native output (`conformance_try_catch_wasm32`
  compiles+links the case in the suite).

### Embedded / bare-metal (Cortex-M, RISC-V MCU) — largest effort
- Needs a **freestanding** runtime: no libc, no OS, custom linker script, and a
  heap for ARC/`malloc`. No reactor, threads, or GUI.
- Only a stripped "core" subset of the language/stdlib is realistic.

---

## 5. IDE Publish dialog (host-aware program publishing)

The IDE's **Publish** dialog exposes only the targets the current IDE host can
build fully or usefully (`ZanIDE.PublishTargetIds`), so users never pick a target
that would fail:

| IDE host   | Targets offered                                              |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows    | `windows-x64`, `windows-arm64`                               |
| macOS      | `macos-arm64`, `macos-x64`, `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`       |
| Linux      | `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`, `macos-arm64`, `macos-x64`       |

- The host's **own** OS/arch is built natively; the other same-OS architecture
  and all Linux targets use the cross paths in §2.
- Cross to a *different* desktop OS is offered from the Linux and macOS hosts
  (each lists the other OS's targets); the **Windows** host offers only Windows
  targets, so Windows ⇄ macOS cross is not offered there. This is a conservative
  IDE product policy, not a compiler/linker limitation: `zanc --target
  macos-{x64,arm64}` can link console, async, atomics and Cocoa GUI from another
  host as described in §2, but those outputs have not yet been executed on real
  Mac hardware. The CLI remains the source of truth for cross-target capability.

---

## 6. Recommended order

1. ~~Android / OHOS CLI (Linux-like reactor, per-NDK sysroot)~~ — both done
   (see §4): Android CLI/GUI-APK and OHOS CLI (`ohos-x64`/`ohos-arm64`).
2. `wasm32` WASI networking/threads model.
3. iOS, then bare-metal.

(Windows cross's async-socket / sync-runtime staging — the former item 1 — is
done; see §4.)

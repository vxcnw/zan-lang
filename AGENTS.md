## Hard rules — DO NOT break these

1. **Keep the repo root clean.** Only long-lived, version-controlled entries
   belong there (source dirs, `CMakeLists.txt`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`,
   `.gitignore`, `AGENTS.md`). Never drop build artifacts, logs, probes,
   one-off scripts, PR drafts, diffs, or patches in the root.
2. **All throwaway files go in `_scratch/`** (git-ignored). This includes
   debug probes, benchmarks, ad-hoc scripts, screenshots, `*.log`, PR bodies,
   commit-message drafts, `*.diff`/`*.patch`. Delete them when done.
3. **Build only out-of-source into `build/`** via `cmake -B build && cmake --build build`.
   Never copy build products into the source tree or root.
4. **Tests go in `tests/`** and are committed. One-off memory/leak probes are
   NOT tests — put them in `_scratch/`.
5. **Use `gh` / the PR template** to open PRs. Do not generate `mkpr*.py`,
   PR-body `.md`, or `*.diff` files in the repo.
6. **`.gitignore` is a safety net, not a license to litter.** Even ignored
   files must not pile up in the source tree.
7. **Every task ends clean — and ends with a commit.** Run `git status` before
   finishing; there should be no stray untracked files. Review
   `git diff --stat` and commit only what the task requires. Never
   `git add .` / `git add -A` blindly. Once the relevant test tier passes,
   **commit on your own**: do not ask for permission and do not leave verified
   work uncommitted. If `git push` fails (e.g. network), leave the commit on
   local `main` and say so. Hold the commit only when verification failed or
   the working tree mixes in unrelated in-flight changes you must not touch.
8. **ctest is NOT the default verification step — never run it casually.**
   Running ctest "to be safe" after every edit is forbidden: it burns tens of
   minutes on this machine and relinking `zanc` invalidates every test
   artifact. Verify a change directly instead: compile and run the affected
   program/probe (`build\zanc.exe <file.zan> --auto-stdlib -o
   _scratch\out.exe`), or diff the one affected golden/diagnostic. Reach for
   ctest only at a real checkpoint, and then always the narrowest tier
   (`scripts\test.ps1 <tier>`, or `ctest -L <tier>`): `smoke` (75 tests) only
   when the compiler/runtime/stdlib itself changed; `standard` (399) only
   before committing compiler/stdlib/runtime work; `full` (1035 —
   determinism/leakcheck twins + self-hosting) release gate only, tens of
   minutes — never casually. A compiler/runtime/stdlib change is exactly such
   a checkpoint (see rule 10): fixing a compiler defect or design flaw MUST be
   backed by ctest — at least the affected `smoke` cases, `standard` before the
   fix is committed; a hand-run probe alone does not verify a compiler fix.
   Narrow further with `-Match`/`-R` when a change
   is local (a generics/ARC change: `-R "generic|leakcheck_generic"`).
   **Nothing else may build while tests run**: the cases share
   `build\zanc.exe` and the stdlib stamp, so a concurrent
   `build_gallery`/`build_ide` makes unrelated cases fail en masse.
9. **Never create branches.** Do NOT create local or remote branches; commit
   directly to `main` and push. Delete any stray branch you find after making
   sure its commits are merged into `main`.
10. **Fix the compiler, don't route around it.** When Zan code fails because the
    compiler/runtime has a bug or a missing capability, the default is to fix
    the compiler or runtime. Do NOT rewrite the Zan code into a shape that
    dodges the defect (hand-rolled `while` instead of a broken `foreach`,
    `string`/`NativeMemory` instead of a broken `byte[]`, a C shim instead of
    the Zan implementation, an extra `count` parameter because arrays lack a
    length). Those workarounds are how the debt in A15 accumulated: each one
    hides the root cause and spreads through the standard library.
    Procedure: reduce it to a minimal probe in `_scratch/`, find the root cause
    in `src/compiler/` or `src/runtime/`, fix it, add a `tests/conformance/`
    case, run the affected ctest tier (rule 8 — a compiler/runtime fix counts
    as verified only once its tier passes), and only then write the natural Zan
    code. If the fix is genuinely out
    of scope for the current task, do not silently work around it: record it in
    `TASKS.md` with the probe and the root cause, say so explicitly, and get
    agreement before shipping any temporary shape.
11. **Concurrent sessions share this working tree — commit finished work the
    moment it is verified.** Do not accumulate completed changes in the working
    tree or index across steps: another session's `git stash pop`, `git reset`,
    or broad `git checkout` can silently overwrite them, which reads as a
    mass-revert of committed features. Commit (and push) each coherent change
    as soon as its test tier passes. Stash discipline: before any
    `git stash`/`push`/`pop`/`apply`, run `git status` — if the tree holds
    another session's in-flight edits or untracked files, isolate your own work
    with a targeted path spec (`git stash push -- <paths>`) or use a separate
    `git worktree`; never pop a stale snapshot over a newer HEAD.
    **Conflicts are repaired, never rolled back or discarded.** Hitting UU index
    entries, `<<<<<<<` markers, or concurrent edits to the same files means two
    lines of work must be **merged by hand**: for each conflicted file compare
    both sides (`git show :2:<file>` = committed/HEAD side, `:3:<file>` =
    in-flight side) against HEAD, keep committed features unconditionally, fold
    in genuinely new work from the other side, verify with the affected test
    tier, resolve **every** UU entry, and commit. Making the conflict "go away"
    is forbidden — no bulk one-sided resolves (`git checkout --ours/--theirs .`,
    `git checkout .`), no `git reset --hard`, no deleting the file or copying an
    older version over it: all of those silently revert committed features and
    read as a mass-revert. Drop one side only after proving it is a stale
    duplicate of already-committed content (evidence: HEAD grep / blob compare).
    Do not leave unresolved conflicts or markers for the next session. Full
    procedure: `docs/WORKSPACE_CONVENTIONS.md` §9.1.

## Build / dev quickstart

**The toolchain of each platform is fixed — see [`docs/BUILD_TOOLCHAIN.md`](docs/BUILD_TOOLCHAIN.md).**
On Windows always configure with clang plus the mozbuild LLVM: letting CMake pick
up TDM-GCC from PATH cannot link zanc, and the failed link deletes
`build\zanc.exe`, taking the whole test suite with it.

```bash
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build            # zanc, zan-lsp, zan-dap, tools
# IDE (self-hosted) is built from src/ide_zan/ZanIDE.zan by zanc.
```

Compile a single program: `build/zanc <file.zan> --auto-stdlib -o out.exe`
Release build of a program: `build/zanc <file.zan> --auto-stdlib --publish -o out.exe`

### CEF browser driver (optional)

`Gui.Component.CefBrowser` ships as an opt-in native driver (`zan_cef` / on
Windows also `zan_cef109` for Win7/8/8.1). It is **off by default** because the
configure step fetches CEF headers from the official Spotify CDN (a few hundred
MB). Enable with:

```bash
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DZAN_BUILD_CEF=ON
# Windows: also build the 109 legacy driver for Win7/8/8.1
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DZAN_BUILD_CEF=ON -DZAN_BUILD_CEF_LEGACY=ON
cmake --build build --target zan_cef
```

Built drivers are staged next to the source (`stdlib/Gui/Component/CefBrowser/drivers/<plat>/`)
so `zanc --publish` carries them with the program. The CEF *runtime* (libcef)
is still downloaded per-machine at first run; see
`examples/gui_cef_browser/README.md` for `ZAN_CEF_*` env vars.

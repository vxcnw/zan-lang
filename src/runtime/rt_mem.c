/* rt_mem.c -- small-object allocator for produced Zan programs.
 *
 * ARC programs allocate constantly: every string, list node, object and
 * coroutine frame is a separate heap block with a very short life. musl's
 * mallocng (the allocator behind the bundled static sysroot) spends a large
 * share of a request in get_meta / alloc_slot / nontrivial_free for exactly
 * that pattern -- an HTTP benchmark showed ~23% of user CPU inside the
 * allocator.
 *
 * This object front-ends malloc/free/calloc/realloc with a size-class cache:
 *   - blocks up to ZAN_MEM_MAX_SMALL come from per-thread free lists carved
 *     out of 1 MiB slabs, so an allocation pops a pointer and a free pushes
 *     one -- no metadata search, no coalescing, no locks;
 *   - anything larger falls through to the libc allocator.
 *
 * Each block records its owning thread cache in its header, and a block freed
 * by another thread goes back to that owner (mimalloc's thread-free list)
 * instead of migrating into the freeing thread's list. The producer/consumer
 * split a server naturally has -- an IO worker allocates the buffer, another
 * worker frees it after the response -- would otherwise drift every block one
 * way and make each thread's cache grow without bound while the owner keeps
 * carving fresh slab space.
 *
 * It is linked with `ld --wrap=malloc,free,calloc,realloc`, so it also sees
 * allocations made inside libc: a pointer that did not come from one of our
 * slabs is handed straight back to the real allocator, decided by an
 * address-range test (never by reading memory we do not own).
 *
 * Slabs are never unmapped: freed blocks stay in their class list and are
 * reused, which is what a long-running server wants.

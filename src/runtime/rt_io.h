/* rt_io.h -- Zan async-IO event loop for coroutine integration.
 *
 * Provides a thin abstraction over platform IO multiplexing:
 *   - Linux:   epoll
 *   - macOS:   kqueue
 *   - Windows: IOCP
 *   - Fallback: select
 *
 * The scheduler calls zan_io_poll() in its main loop to wake coroutines
 * whose file descriptors became readable or writable.
 *
 * Coroutines call zan_io_wait_readable / zan_io_wait_writable to suspend
 * until their fd is ready.  These functions are the async-IO ABI that the
 * Zan compiler (or stdlib DllImport) can call.

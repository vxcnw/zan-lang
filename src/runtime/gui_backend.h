/* gui_backend.h -- render backend seam for the GUI runtime.
 *
 * Every drawing primitive Zan can reach arrives through the ~45 zan_gui_*
 * exports in gui_runtime.c (stdlib/Gui/Render.zan holds their [DllImport]
 * declarations, and no widget ever touches pixels directly), so this is the one
 * place a second rasterizer has to be plugged in: a surface carries a backend
 * pointer, each export validates its arguments and then hands the call to that
 * backend. The exported ABI does not change, and neither does any Zan code.
 *
 * The built-in software rasterizer is itself a backend (`zan_cpu_backend`), and
 * it is what an entry a backend leaves NULL falls back to -- so a GPU backend
 * can implement the primitives it accelerates and inherit the rest. It stays
 * the permanent fallback for machines with no usable GPU context (remote
 * desktops, VMs, CI); a NULL backend pointer on a surface means the CPU path.
 *
 * Entries are the primitives, not the exports: the mask-less entry points
 * (fill_rounded_rect, fill_circle without a corner mask, ...) fold into their
 * masked form, so a backend implements ~20 entries rather than 45. Where two
 * exports differ in more than an argument -- an opaque vertical gradient vs. a
 * blended multi-stop one, a single anti-aliased line vs. a whole polyline in
 * one coverage pass -- they keep separate entries: collapsing them would make
 * the seam lossy, i.e. no backend could reproduce both.
 *
 * Which backend a surface gets is the *application's* choice (Gui.App exposes
 * it; ZanIDE persists it in its own profile). It is deliberately not an
 * environment variable: one machine-wide switch shared by every Zan program on
 * the box is not a setting.

/* genrun.h -- run the Zan-scripted code generators (ZanGen).
 *
 * The compiler's source-generators (formgen/scenegen/jsongen/routegen/dbgen)
 * were moved out of C into Zan code living in stdlib/System/Compiler/. zanc
 * drives them through a subprocess: it exports the compilation-unit metadata
 * to a JSON file, runs the cached generator executable over it, and consumes
 * the generated source + rewrite directives from the reply JSON.
 *
 * The generator is compiled with zanc itself (it is ordinary Zan code) and
 * cached under the user cache dir, keyed by the compiler, stdlib root and
 * generator source contents: a cold cache costs one extra compile, a warm
 * cache one spawn per build.
 *
 * --no-gen (zan_gen_enabled = 0) disables the whole machinery; it exists to
 * compile the generators themselves, whose sources must not run the codegen
 * passes on themselves (a bootstrap loop).

"""Rewrite the RA2 self-test screenshot paths onto the run-scoped ShotPath().

Every capture must land in that run's own directory, so a stale file can
never be read as a fresh one. This rewrites the string literal
"build/ra2_shot_x.bmp" into Ra2App.ShotPath("ra2_shot_x.bmp").

Deterministic, so it can be re-run after a checkout without double-applying.
